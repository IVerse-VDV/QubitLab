# 03. Quantum Applications and Concepts

This folder covers applications and important conceptual topics in quantum mechanics beyond the formalism: entanglement, measurement, decoherence, tunneling, and the ways quantum behavior shows up in physical systems. These materials help in seeing how quantum theory is used and what foundational puzzles arise.

## Papers & Articles

1. [Quantum Entanglement: Separability, Measure, Fidelity of Teleportation and Distillation – Ming Li, Shao-Ming Fei, Xianqing Li-Jost (2010, arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.4706)  
   A detailed review covering how one characterizes entanglement: criteria for separable vs entangled states, measures (like fidelity), and applications such as teleportation and distillation.

2. [Entanglement Entropy: Holography and Renormalization Group – Tatsuma Nishioka (2018, arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.10352)  
   Explores entanglement entropy in quantum field theories and holography, including its divergence structure and universal components; useful for understanding how entanglement scales in large systems.

3. [An Introduction to Quantum Entanglement: a Geometric Approach – Karol Życzkowski & Ingemar Bengtsson (2006, arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0606228)  
   Treats entanglement from a geometric perspective: separability, measures, and special cases (especially two-qubit systems), emphasizing the geometry of the state space.

4. [Open Quantum Dynamics: Complete Positivity and Entanglement – F. Benatti & R. Floreanini (2005, arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0507271)  
   Reviews open quantum systems and how entanglement behaves when subsystems interact with environments; includes discussions of complete positivity and decoherence effects.

5. [The Measurement Problem in Quantum Mechanics – Johan Hansson (2021, public article)](https://ijqf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Quantum-Measurement-Problem.pdf)  
   A clear introduction to the measurement problem: the tension between deterministic evolution via Schrödinger equation vs collapse, and various conceptual approaches to resolve this.

6. [The Measurement Problem in Quantum Mechanics (Bachelor Thesis) – Eric Gil Portal (2021, Universitat de Barcelona)](https://diposit.ub.edu/dspace/bitstream/2445/180305/1/GIL%20PORTAL%20ERIC_3085535_assignsubmission_file_TFG-Gil-Portal-Eric.pdf)  
   A student thesis that presents a survey of the measurement problem and the main proposed interpretations; good for seeing how foundational ideas are laid out in accessible form.
