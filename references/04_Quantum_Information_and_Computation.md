## Papers & Lecture Notes

1. [Quantum Information Lecture Notes – Johannes Kofler (2025)](https://www.jku.at/fileadmin/gruppen/180/2025_Quantum_Information_Lecture_Notes.pdf)  
   Comprehensive lecture notes covering basics of quantum information: definitions, quantum states and channels, entanglement, quantum algorithms.

2. [Coherent and squeezed states: introductory review of basic notions, properties and generalizations – Oscar Rosas-Ortiz (2018-2019, arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07523)  
   A gentle-to-intermediate review of coherent and squeezed states, useful for understanding quantum optics basics, including history and mathematical properties.  

3. [‘Nonclassical’ states in quantum optics: a ‘squeezed’ review of the first 75 years – V. V. Dodonov (2002)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1464-4266/4/1/201)  
   A historical and conceptual survey of nonclassical states like coherent and squeezed states, how they were introduced, and their applications in quantum optics.  

4. [Entanglement in many-body quantum systems – Ignacio Cirac (2012, arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.3742)  
   Review that bridges quantum information and many-body physics: discusses area laws, tensor network states, and how entanglement scales in large quantum systems.

5. [Probing quantum correlations in many-body systems: a review of scalable methods – Irénée Frérot, Matteo Fadel, Maciej Lewenstein (2023, arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00640)  
   Focuses on practical and scalable methods to detect and measure quantum correlations in large systems, important for experiments where full state tomography is impractical.

6. [Many-body localization, thermalization, and entanglement – Abanin, Altman, Bloch, Serbyn (2018, arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.11065)  
   Discusses systems that do not thermalize due to strong disorder; entanglement growth in these systems, integrals of motion, and theoretical understandings of localization.  

7. [Measuring entanglement entropy through the interference of quantum many-body twins – Islam, Ma, Preiss, Tai, Lukin, Rispoli, Greiner (2015, arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01160)  
   Experimental method for measuring entanglement entropy using two copies of a many-body state; helpful to understand how to measure entanglement in practice.
