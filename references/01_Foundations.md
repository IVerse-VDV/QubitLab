# 01. Foundations

This folder is dedicated to fundamental works on the foundations of quantum mechanics: the conceptual structure, mathematical underpinnings, and classic debates.

## Papers & Lecture Notes

1. [Foundations of Quantum Mechanics – Travis Norsen (2017)](https://pages.jh.edu/rrynasi1/HealeySeminar/literature/Norsen2017FoundationsOfQuantumMechanics.pdf)  
   A modern discussion of conceptual issues in quantum theory: realism, locality, measurement, and various interpretational approaches.  

2. [The Nature of Schrödinger Equation – Zhao et al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.06198)  
   Investigates derivations and interpretations of the Schrödinger equation, and its relation to stochastic or classical wave pictures.  

3. [The Schrödinger–Newton Equation and Its Foundations – Bahrami et al. (2014)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.4370)  
   Explores a semi-classical gravitational modification of quantum mechanics (nonlinear coupling of wavefunction to gravity) and foundational implications.  

4. [Schrödinger’s original quantum-mechanical solution for hydrogen – Galler et al. (2021)](https://site.physics.georgetown.edu/~jkf/publications/schrodinger_ejp_2021.pdf)  
   Revisits Schrödinger’s original method of solving the hydrogen atom via the Laplace method, giving insight into historical derivations.

5. [The Schrödinger Equation (Lecture Notes, Stanford)](https://web.stanford.edu/~oas/SI/QM/notes/QMLect5.pdf)  
   Lecture notes explaining the Schrödinger equation, its origin, and basic solutions (time-dependent and time-independent forms).

6. [Wave mechanics and the Schrödinger equation (Lecture Handout, Cambridge)](https://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/~bds10/aqp/handout_foundations.pdf)  
   A handout that introduces wave mechanics and the formal development of the Schrödinger equation.

7. [“1926 – Schrödinger’s original paper (quantization as eigenvalue problem)”](https://ee.sharif.edu/~sarvari/25290/1926-Schrodinger.pdf)  
   The historic original publication by Schrödinger introducing wave mechanics.  

8. [Foundations of Quantum Mechanics (article) – Salim Yasmineh, 2022](https://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/22081/1/encyclopedia-02-00071%20%284%29.pdf)  
   A review / encyclopedia entry giving an accessible overview of the conceptual foundations and interpretations.
