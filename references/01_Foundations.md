# 01 Foundations

This folder gathers key resources on the **foundations of Quantum Mechanics**.  
It introduces the mathematical framework, core postulates, and conceptual issues such as measurement, uncertainty, and interpretation.  
The papers and lecture notes below are arranged to help both beginners and advanced learners build a solid understanding.

## Papers & Lecture Notes

1. [Foundations of Quantum Mechanics – Travis Norsen (2017)](https://pages.jh.edu/rrynasi1/HealeySeminar/literature/Norsen2017FoundationsOfQuantumMechanics.pdf)  
   *A modern overview of the conceptual and philosophical issues at the foundation of quantum theory, including realism, locality, and measurement.*

2. [Quantum Mechanics Made Simple – W.C. Chew (2016, Lecture Notes)](https://engineering.purdue.edu/wcchew/course/QMAll20161206.pdf)  
   *Introductory lecture notes that explain the Schrödinger equation, operators, eigenvalue problems, and basic quantum principles in a concise way.*

3. [Evolution of Schrödinger Uncertainty Relation – A. Angelow (2007, arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0710.0670)  
   *Discusses the development of the uncertainty principle, its generalizations, and its importance in the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics.*

4. [Spin and Uncertainty in the Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics – D. Hestenes (1979)](https://davidhestenes.net/geocalc/pdf/Spin%26uncert.pdf)
