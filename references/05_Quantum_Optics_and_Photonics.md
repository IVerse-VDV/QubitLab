# 05_Quantum_Optics_and_Photonics

This folder gathers important papers and notes in quantum optics and photonics, especially focusing on nonclassical light, squeezed/coherent states, generation of nonclassical states, and how these phenomena interface with applications like metrology and quantum information.

## Papers & Lecture Notes

1. ['Nonclassical' states in quantum optics: a 'squeezed' review of the first 75 years – V. V. Dodonov (2002)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1464-4266/4/1/201)  
   A comprehensive historical and conceptual review of nonclassical light (coherent states, squeezed states, etc.), tracing how the definitions and experimental/theoretical techniques evolved over ~75 years.  

2. [A squeezed review on coherent states and nonclassicality for non-Hermitian systems with minimal length – Sanjib Dey, Andreas Fring, Véronique Hussin (2018, arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01139)  
   Explores coherent and nonclassical states in the context of non-Hermitian quantum systems, and considers minimal length modifications.  

3. [Operational resource theory of nonclassicality via quantum metrology – Wenchao Ge, Kurt Jacobs, Saeed Asiri, Michael Foss-Feig, M. Suhail Zubairy (2020, Phys. Rev. Research)](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.023400)  
   Develops quantitative measures of nonclassicality with operational meaning, especially as relates to metrological applications (how nonclassical states can enhance precision).  

4. [Demonstrating higher-order nonclassical effects by photon-added classical states: Realistic schemes – Juhui Lee, Jaewan Kim, Hyunchul Nha (2009, arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/abs/0902.0112)  
   Proposes schemes where classical states (coherent or thermal) are modified (photon-addition) to reveal nonclassical effects beyond just sub-Poissonian statistics or quadrature squeezing.
