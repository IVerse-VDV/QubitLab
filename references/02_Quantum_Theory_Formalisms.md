# 02_Quantum_Theory_Formalisms

This folder contains materials and papers on different mathematical formalisms of quantum mechanics: Hilbert spaces, operators, path integrals, density matrices, etc. These resources help understand how quantum mechanics is formulated from different viewpoints.

## Papers & Lecture Notes

1. [A short introduction to the quantum formalism(s) – François David (2012)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1211.5627)  
   Provides a coherent and relatively non-technical overview of several formalisms: the canonical formalism, algebraic formalism, quantum logic; also discusses their physical justifications in terms of causality, reversibility, locality.

2. [The Path Integral Approach to Quantum Mechanics – Riccardo Rattazzi (2009)](https://docslib.org/doc/798593/the-path-integral-approach-to-quantum-mechanics-lecture-notes-for-quantum-mechanics-iv)  
   Lecture notes explaining the path integral formulation: how it connects to the Schrödinger approach, its use for free particles and harmonic oscillators, and functional/Euclidean methods.

3. [The Density Matrix – Peter Young (2020)](https://young.physics.ucsc.edu/150/density-matrix.pdf)  
   Introduces the concept of density matrix, showing how mixed states and subsystems are described when you dont have access to full system; useful for quantum statistics and open quantum systems.
